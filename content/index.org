Most of my current code/configs are in [[https://github.com/voutilad][my Github]] at the moment, but
here are some highlights.

** /An HAProxy config for single-server Neo4j/
Need to tunnel http to Neo4j Browser AND Bolt (both plain and
websocket based) connections over the same TLS-enabled port?

Bonus "LetsEncrypt" script for automating certbot:

Tested and works in recent (19.x) Ubuntu environments.

** =virtio_vmmci=
My 3/4-hearted attempt at a Linux virtio driver for OpenBSD VMM
Control Interface. Handles some guest/host communication related to
clock sync and host shutdown/restart events.
